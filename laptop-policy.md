You are welcome (encouraged even) to bring a laptop to class. However, when your laptop is out you are *expected* to participate in the Class Discussion section of the course forum. Use Class Discussion to take notes, to ask questions and to comment on the proceedings. This section is also good for students who are too shy to speak in class and will be counted towards the participation grade.
