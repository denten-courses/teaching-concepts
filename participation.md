Participation includes some mixture of your class participation, weekly response posts, and community moderation. You can think of it as ~50% online and ~50% in class, although the formula is much more complicated. The balance between online and in person allows people not accustumed to talking in class, or those with health issues, to make up for their absence online.

Community moderation involves responding to others on the forum (at least two posts every other week) and bringing the online discussion into the in-class conversation. At the end of the semester, your grade is determened by:

1. Stats about your online postings (number, timeliness, etc). I calculate something like average activity (usually exactly at minimum requirement), which then becomes the baseline for an A (!). Anything over that is extra, which allows quiet people in class to raise their classroom participation grade.

2. Subjective instructor evaluation on the quality of your posts and in-class participation for a fraction of the grade.

3. Self-evaluation, which works in a tricky way, narrowly penalizing large gaps in overconfidence otherwise giving small true weight to your own self assessment.
