title: How to Write a Good Forum Post

Here are several principles that may help you write a good forum or blog post on our site and elsewhere:

* Remember the format.  Short entries are conducive to concise observation.  Do not tackle a topic that cannot be discussed in depth in 2-3 paragraphs.

* Short-format writing is amenable to shorter paragraphs.  Turn those 2-3 paragraphs into 4-5 when appropriate (one paragraph per thought or idea).  Give structure to your post, use the whitespace (indentation, blank lines, lists) to make your message more readable.

* Be specific.  Rather than commenting on the text as a whole, choose a specific idea, a specific sentence or passage.

* When selecting a passage, pick something you find puzzling, fascinating, strange, or particularly apt or inapt.  Account for your reaction.

* Contextualize your observation within the larger themes of the class, or within the work as a whole.  How does your small observation fit within the big picture?

* Respond to others.

* Keep your audience in mind.  Is this going to be interesting/insightful/provocative to your peers?

* Maintain a thread between your observations.  Are you drawn to particular issues or particular fields of expertise?  Write about what moves you.

* When you are done, ask yourself, "What question did I raise or answer here?"  The best kinds of questions are non-trivial, challenging, and provoking.  They invite further thought and response from your readers.
    
* Frame.  Return to your point of initial inquiry to see what it looks like after your discussion. 

* Remember to use a spell-checker.  Sloppy spelling will obscure your message and diminish your authority.
