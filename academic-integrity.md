When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors, and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the risk. Consult Culumbiaâ€™s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or ask me for help early in the writing process.
