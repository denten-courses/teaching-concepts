I do not hold traditional office hours. They are not used well most of the time. Instead, I am committed to promptly answering your emails, often within minutes. I am on campus daily during the day, and my office door is usually ajar to welcome all visitors. Please feel free to drop by at any time, but do email first to make sure I am there. 

Do not hesitate to stop by, or write me to schedule a more lengthy meeting. Open communications are key for a successful semester.
